Control, we've found him he's ok.

Control, We're to late looks like his fire went out and he froze.


If I don't keep this fire lit i'm, going to freeze.

To dangerous to walk at night, my only chance is to keep the fire lit until help gets here. 

I don't have another match so it better not go out

Ah Logs i'll need those if i'm to get out of this
